# SwaddlesForWaddles
Memes for a cause. 

## What is it?
Swaddles for Waddles is a meme generator that was inspired by oil spills near Australia in 2014. Enironmentalists in the area made a call to action for knitters to send in sweaters for the affeted penguins. </br>
While that issuse has long since been taken care of, Swaddles for Waddles allows the conversation for oil spills, penguins, and fun community efforts to continue. Additionally, there is a (mock) page to donate to help penguins through the World Wild Life Foundation. 
## Real World Application

Offering information on the problem </br>2. Offering a way to help (donations)</br> 3. Offering entertainment</br> In today's world, this is a good model to increase engagement in various social problems.
